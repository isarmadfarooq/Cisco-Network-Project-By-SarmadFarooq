# 🧠 CCNA Networking Projects Portfolio by Sarmad Farooq

Welcome to my **Networking Projects Portfolio** — a curated collection of practical and hands-on networking labs built using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. These projects are designed to demonstrate my understanding and application of networking concepts aligned with the **Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)** curriculum.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves three key purposes:

1. ✅ **Showcase My Skills** – Demonstrates my hands-on knowledge in routing, switching, IP addressing, subnetting, VLANs, wireless, ACLs, NAT, and more.
2. 🚀 **Build My Professional Portfolio** – To help me land internships, freelance work, or a full-time role as a **Network Engineer**.
3. 📚 **Help Other Learners** – A free learning resource for other CCNA students to follow along and practice.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each project is organized in its own folder and includes:
- ✅ `.pkt` file (Cisco Packet Tracer lab)
- 📝 `README.md` with objectives, topology, IP schema, and configuration steps
- 📷 Screenshots (when needed)
- 📌 Reflection or summary of what was learned
